# Knowledge Base Creation Tool

A demonstration tool showcasing the creation, management, and deployment of specialized knowledge bases for AI applications. This interactive demo illustrates how domain experts, knowledge builders, and organizations can leverage structured knowledge to enhance AI capabilities.

![Knowledge Base Creation Tool Demo](public/images/logos/kb-demo-header.png)

## 🌟 Overview

The Knowledge Base Creation Tool demonstrates how specialized domain knowledge can be transformed into formats that AI systems can accurately utilize, reducing hallucinations and improving response quality. The demo provides three distinct user flows:

1. **Domain Expert Flow** - For practitioners who want to enhance their practice with AI
2. **Knowledge Builder Flow** - For technical creators who want to build and monetize knowledge bases
3. **AI Enhancer Flow** - For organizations looking to find and deploy pre-built knowledge bases

## ✨ Key Features

- **Multi-user perspective** - Experience the tool from three distinct user viewpoints
- **Interactive knowledge visualization** - See how domain knowledge is structured for AI consumption
- **AI testing interface** - Compare AI responses with and without specialized knowledge
- **Marketplace simulation** - Browse, evaluate, and purchase knowledge bases
- **Publishing workflow** - Experience the process of preparing a knowledge base for the marketplace
- **Deployment options** - Explore different ways to integrate knowledge bases with existing systems

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **React** - Frontend UI library
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **React Context API** - State management
- **Recharts** - Data visualization
- **Mock API** - Simulated backend for demo purposes

## 🎮 Usage Guide

### Starting the Demo

When you launch the application, you'll be presented with three options:
- **Domain Expert** - For practitioners who want to enhance their practice with AI
- **Knowledge Builder** - For technical creators who want to build and monetize knowledge bases
- **AI Enhancer** - For organizations looking to find and deploy pre-built knowledge bases

Select one to begin the corresponding user flow.

### Domain Expert Flow

1. **Welcome & Setup**: Configure your practice profile and domain
2. **Content Upload**: Upload domain-specific documents
3. **Knowledge Review**: Visualize and explore your knowledge map
4. **Testing & Refinement**: Test AI responses with your knowledge
5. **Practice Integration**: Configure deployment options

### Knowledge Builder Flow

1. **Project Setup**: Configure technical specifications for your knowledge base
2. **Advanced Content Processing**: Process and organize domain content
3. **Knowledge Engineering**: Structure and optimize your knowledge base
4. **Testing & Optimization**: Test and refine AI responses
5. **Marketplace Publishing**: Prepare and publish to the marketplace

### AI Enhancer Flow

1. **Need Identification**: Specify your requirements and use case
2. **Marketplace Browsing**: Browse available knowledge bases
3. **Knowledge Base Evaluation**: Evaluate and test knowledge bases
4. **Purchase & Access**: Configure purchase options
5. **Deployment Options**: Set up deployment in your environment

## 🔍 Demo Scenarios

The demo includes several pre-configured scenarios:

### Healthcare Scenario

## 📊 Technical Details

### State Management

The application uses React Context API for state management, with separate contexts for:
- User session state (selected user type, current step)
- Content state (uploaded files, knowledge map)
- Marketplace state (browsed knowledge bases, selected products)

### Simulation Approach

As this is a demonstration tool, all backend processes are simulated:
- File processing is visualized but not actually performed
- AI responses are pre-configured examples
- Marketplace listings are mock data

### Performance Considerations

The demo is optimized for demonstration purposes:
- Lazy loading of components for each user flow
- Efficient rendering of knowledge visualizations
- Minimal dependencies to ensure fast loading
