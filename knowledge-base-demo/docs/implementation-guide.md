# Knowledge Base Creation Tool Implementation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing the Knowledge Base Creation Tool demonstration using Cursor or any other React development environment.

## Setup and Project Structure

### 1. Initialize a New React Project

```bash
# Create a new React project
npx create-react-app knowledge-base-demo
cd knowledge-base-demo

# Install required dependencies
npm install react-router-dom tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

### 2. Set Up Tailwind CSS

```bash
# Initialize Tailwind CSS
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Update the `tailwind.config.js` file:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Add Tailwind directives to `src/index.css`:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### 3. Create Project Structure

Create the following folder structure:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── common/
│   ├── domain-expert/
│   ├── knowledge-builder/
│   ├── ai-enhancer/
│   └── visualization/
├── context/
├── data/
├── utils/
└── App.js
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Context Provider

Create the file `src/context/DemoContext.js` using the state management implementation code provided in the artifacts. This will serve as the central state management for the entire application.

### 2. Implement Common Components

Start by implementing the common components that are shared across all user flows:

1. `UserTypeSelector.jsx` - Entry point for selecting user type
2. `StepNavigator.jsx` - Navigation between steps
3. `App.js` - Main application component

### 3. Implement Domain Expert Flow Components

1. `WelcomeSetup.jsx` - Initial setup for domain experts
2. `FileUploader.jsx` - Document upload and processing
3. `KnowledgeMapVisualizer.jsx` - Knowledge visualization
4. `AITestingInterface.jsx` - Testing AI responses
5. `PracticeIntegration.jsx` - Deployment options

### 4. Implement Knowledge Builder Flow Components

1. `ProjectSetup.jsx` - Technical project configuration
2. `AdvancedProcessing.jsx` - Advanced content processing
3. `KnowledgeEngineering.jsx` - Knowledge structure editing
4. `MarketplacePublishing.jsx` - Publishing to marketplace

### 5. Implement AI Enhancer Flow Components

1. `MarketplaceBrowser.jsx` - Browse available knowledge bases
2. `KnowledgeBaseEvaluation.jsx` - Preview and test knowledge bases
3. `PurchaseConfig.jsx` - Configure purchase options
4. `DeploymentOptions.jsx` - Deployment configuration

### 6. Integration Testing

Test each user flow to ensure smooth navigation and proper state management:

1. Domain Expert user journey
2. Knowledge Builder user journey
3. AI Enhancer user journey

## Component Implementation Details

### Main App Component

The main `App.js` file orchestrates the entire application by:
1. Wrapping everything in the DemoProvider
2. Routing to the appropriate component based on user type and current step
3. Providing navigation controls

### Entry Point Component

The `UserTypeSelector.jsx` component:
1. Presents three user type options
2. Sets the user type in the global state
3. Guides users to the appropriate flow based on their selection

### Step Navigation

The `StepNavigator.jsx` component:
1. Shows progression through the flow
2. Allows users to navigate to previous steps
3. Adapts labeling based on user type

### Content Processing

The `FileUploader.jsx` component:
1. Provides drag-and-drop file upload
2. Simulates processing with a realistic progress indicator
3. Shows document organization

### Knowledge Visualization

The `KnowledgeMapVisualizer.jsx` component:
1. Presents an interactive visualization of the knowledge structure
2. Shows relationships between content pieces
3. Provides metrics on coverage and gaps

### AI Testing Interface

The `AITestingInterface.jsx` component:
1. Simulates conversational AI interaction
2. Demonstrates difference between generic and knowledge-enhanced AI
3. Shows attribution to sources

### Marketplace Browser

The `MarketplaceBrowser.jsx` component:
1. Displays available knowledge bases with filtering options
2. Supports comparison between options
3. Presents pricing and other key information

## Simulation and Mock Data

Since this is a demonstration, the implementation uses simulated processes and mock data:

1. File processing is simulated with progress indicators instead of actual processing
2. Knowledge maps are pre-configured based on user type and scenario
3. AI responses are pre-written examples that demonstrate the concept
4. Marketplace listings are mock data representing realistic options

Mock data generators are included in their respective components to create realistic data based on the user's selections.

## Deployment

To deploy the demonstration:

```bash
# Build the production version
npm run build

# Deploy to your preferred hosting service
# Example for GitHub Pages
npm install gh-pages --save-dev

# Add to package.json
# "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/knowledge-base-demo",
# "scripts": {
#   "predeploy": "npm run build",
#   "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
# }

npm run deploy
```

## Extending the Demo

To extend the demonstration with additional features:

1. **Real API Integration**: Replace mock data with real API calls to a backend service
2. **File Processing**: Implement actual file processing with machine learning models
3. **User Authentication**: Add user accounts and authentication
4. **Persistent Storage**: Save progress and configurations to a database
5. **Custom Knowledge Visualization**: Implement more sophisticated knowledge graph visualization

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **State Management Issues**: Check that you're properly using the DemoContext in every component
2. **Styling Problems**: Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured and imported
3. **Component Rendering**: Verify conditional logic for showing components based on step number
4. **Mock Data**: If components show empty data, check the mock data generators
