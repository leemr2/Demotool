# Knowledge Builder User Flow

## Overview

This document outlines the user flow for knowledge builders using the Knowledge Base Demo platform.

## Flow Steps

### 1. Project Setup
- User selects "Knowledge Builder" role
- System displays project setup interface
- User provides project information:
  - Project name
  - Description
  - Domain area
  - Target audience
  - Timeline
  - Resources

### 2. Advanced Processing
- User uploads source materials
- System processes documents:
  - Text extraction
  - Entity recognition
  - Relationship mapping
  - Quality assessment
- User can:
